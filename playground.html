        <p>Jello, and welcome. In this course you will learn the basic command line tool you will need to use the cdm or
            the terminal.</p>

        <p>Please ask yourself the same question I am asking myself, which is WHY DO I SOUND SO POLITE. UGH!</p>

        <p>You have probably used a command line interface before. Javascript on the web, or the interprator for Python.
        </p>

        <p>The idea of a CLI gpes back to the mid 20th Century. It was one one of the only ways that people had to
            communicate with the computer.</p>

        <p>Today, terminal usually means a piece of software but it originally meant a physical piece of
            hardware for interacting
            with the computer. Before terminals, there was the use of punch cards to insert information into
            computers loading a
            batch all at once.</p>

        <p>The terminal was a major improvement. it allowed information to be input not at once, but anyhow
            and showed results
            immediately. This explains why it is being used till date.</p>

        <p>The CLI is programmable, efficient in its use of network bandwidth nd you can use them to edit
            files in a remote system
            without having to first copy them into your ocal machine. In general you can be much more
            expressive with the CLI than
            you could ever be with pointing and clicking.</p>

        <h4>Command Line Interface</h4>

        <p>There are command line systems everywhere. Google Chrome has a developer tool section that
            provides a CLI. Python also
            provides a CLI to use with their inteprator ( Python's interactive interpreter.). A Command Line
            Interface therefore is
            any computer interface where the user enters textual commands and gets textual responses back.
        </p>

        <p>In this tutrial, we mostly wore with the Linux Command Line Interface in a VM, however, in order
            to access that you need

        <p>I am sure you have setup the CLI successfully and if this seems new to you you’re eager to see

        <p>Let us break stuff.</p>

        <h1>[INSERT GIF]</h1>

        <p>Using the $ sign as a landmark lets begin. The left of the $ sign shows your current position.
            That is, what folder you
            are currently on.</p>

        <p>Just like when you turn on your Computer your working environment by default is the desktop, by
            default the HOME
            DIRECTORY is the working which is shown on the left side of the $ sign.</p>

        <p> <b>NOTE:</b> Do not forget, the CLI is a textual representation of the UI we are so familair
            with.</p>

        <h1>[INSERT GIF]</h1>

        <p>The right side of the $ is where you type your instructions.</p>

        <p>Now then, type in anything and hit enter. Do not worry if you see something as below. It is
            perfectly normal as whatever
            was typed randomly was not a correct instruction.</p>

        <p>Try this also:</p>

        <p>Which is the right way to use an apostrophe. “‘?"</p>

        <h1>[Insert gif]</h1>

        <p>Most CLI look similar. they usually include the login user’s name, the host name(name of computer
            log into), and some
            information such as the current time and what folder the user is in.</p>

        <p>You can new commands after every prompt. After hitting enter, the command runs and the output is
            rinted to the screen.</p>

        <p>After the output is printed, a fresh prompt is added to the bottom of the terminal ready for your
            next command.</p>

        <p>See if you can lable the parts fo the CLI below.</p>

        <h3>Page 4: Terminal vs The Shell</h3>

        <p>One thing to underatnd isn the dfferent between the terminal and the shell.</p>

        <p>The terminal is a program that draws text in its windows and lets you type things in with the
            keyboard.</p>

        <p>The termnal itself doesnt know what to do with that input. It relies on the shell for that. WHen
            you tye things into the
            terminal, it sends what is typed to The Shell which is a separate program.</p>

        <p>When you press Enter, the shell interprets what you typed in as a command, inteprates that
            command, figures out what
            program you want to run, runs it and sends the output nack to the terminal so you can view it.
        </p>

        <p>Although there are a lot of shell programs you can choose from such as TCSH, KSH and Seashell,
            etc. they all. work very
            slightly and have various different features</p>

        <p>The default one on the Linux system and the Mac is called the GNU bash. For this tutorial we will
            be using the GNU Bash.</p>

        <p><b>NOTE:</b> You can also use the shell wthout the terminal. You can write shell commands into a
            file and arrange for your to
            computer to run the shell program on that file. This is called shell scripting and that is
            beyoud the scope of this
            programmer. LOL.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="list-group">
        <h3>Page 5: Command Trial</h3>

        <p>The best way to use the shell is to keep trying over and over again.</p>

        <p>Below is are 8 sample linux commands. Match the green texts, commands, to the correct meaning in
            functionality. Match the green fields to the right blue fields.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Date</li>
            <li>expr 2 + 2</li>
            <li>echo you rock</li>
            <li>uname</li>
            <li>hostname</li>
            <li>host GitHub.com</li>
            <li>bash --version</li>
            <li>history</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>NOTE:</b> You may notice that some commands are just one word whikst others have 1 or more words following
            them. They are called command line arguments. They are inputs you provide to some command line inputs when
            you run it. The command name is just the first word and whatever follows it is the command line arguments.

        <p>The key thing to take away from this tutorial is that you would want to think of terminal commands as
            function calls.</p>

        <h1>[INSERT GIF] => rm crazyfile.txt</h1>

        <p>the above command can be carried out in code also. os.remove(“crazyfile.txt”)</p>

        <p>Notice that they bare similarities. They both take the file names as their parameter, however, they both call
            the
            commands differently.</p>
