        <p>Congratulation! You made it to the green 3rd of the tutorial.</p>

        <p>Now you have famialiarized yourelf with certain shell commands and the terminal doesnt look weird to you anymore.</p>

        <p>This lessons contains even more shell commands with more practice to them.</p>

        <p>We will be working with files and directories a lot in this section. Let’s go!</p>

        <h4>Part 1:</h4>

        <p>We begin with a Quiz</p>

        <p>Choose what each of these files are likely to be. Like what kinda things do you expect to find in these files.</p>

        <p>Be free to use your favoirite search engine. No pressure here. The point is to familarize your with files and
        directories</p>

        <h4>PART 2: HISTORY</h4>

        <p>When I found out about accessing my history I was pretty pumped.</p>

        <p>You can use the up arrow to go through your most recent command entered. Hit it two times and you will be shown the
        second most recent command you entered. Do it the 3rd time and… You get the idea.</p>

        <h3>[INSERT GIF] => UP ARROW</h3>

        <hr>

        <h3>[INSERT GIF] => history</h3>

        <p>To get histroy of all commands enetred during a particular session type history</p>

        <p>This shows all commands run in the past also.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>There is another powerful tool though. I will allow you to figure it out for yourself what it does. Foolow these steps.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Open your terminal</li>
            <li>Mac:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>control + r</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Windows:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>ctrl + r</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Type anything</li>
            <li>Withing the green textfield, type what you think is going on.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Next is curl. This is command that is used to transfer data from or to a server using one of the supported protocols
        HTTP, HTTPS, FTP</p>

        <h2>[INSERT GIF] => Downloading curl -o things.zip http://udacity.github.io/ud595-shell/stuff.zip</h2>

        <p>[However, be sure to CD to a safe spot first]</p>

        <p>Next, run unzip things.zip to unzip the zip file unto whatever location you’re presentaly on.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Consider the .txt files which were just dumped onto your current working directory.</p>

        <p>cat [filename] [filename] is used to concatenate files, output them onto th screen for reading.</p>

        <p>You can run cat [filename] on a single file, allowable, to view the contents of a single file</p>
