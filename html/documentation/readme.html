                    <h3>READme</h3>
            
                    <p>Imagine having to pick up a Calculus Textbook with 569 pages worth of information. What is contained in the
                        book is no
                        simple text, just number and symbols. Almost as if the author of the book just negelected to write words
                        humans could
                        understand.</p>
            
                    <p>The author sucks, right? Yea! I know! But check this out. The author is you and I and the reader of our books
                        are the
                        Professors, our friends and our future selves.</p>
            
                    <p>Very briefly, this tutorial will serves to answer</p>
            
                    <ul>
                        <li>What a READme is,</li>
                        <li>stress the importance</li>
                        <li>structure to a simple READme</li>
                    </ul>
            
                    <h2>What then is a READme file?</h2>
            
                    <p>A READme file is a text file (.txt, .md) that contains information about the software created for you (future
                        you), the
                        client, user, and anyone who could be a beneficiary of the software at hand. All for the user.</p>
            
                    <p>That is the importance of the documentation — the purpose of READMEs. Documenting your code, beit commenting
                        of writing
                        READmes is just like a clean cookbook. When thourghly written, it provides for the user or the implementator
                        a stronger
                        foundation to better feel as to how well to use the software or program at hand. I exists to help humans
                        make sense of
                        the code that we have written.</p>
            
                    <p>To be specific, READme as a documentation is to humans as code is to computers — well, your future self, a
                        future
                        employer, and many others. However, when writing a READme file, you should write them as though a 5 year old
                        was going
                        to use them as a manual before using your software.</p>
            
                    <p>You will want it to be easy for anyone to dive into your code and get it up and running without any hiccups!

                    <h3>Anatomy of a READme file</h3>
            
                    <hr>
            
                    <h4>Title:</h4>
                    <p>Well, this is what the name says it is.</p>
            
                    <h4>Description:</h4>
                    <p>With this a sentence or two would be good. Be sure to put enough context to capture the spirit of your
                        project to get
                        the user up and running.</p>
            
                    <h4>Installation:</h4>
                    <p>Provide for the user the “HOW" to install your program. This step is most critical as it is what will lead
                        the way to
                        how to better use your program.</p>
            
                    <p>Here, you include step by step process to install the application.</p>
            
                    <p>Make mention of any needed dependancies and/or libraries that should be installed before installation.</p>
            
                    Also, be sure to specify the process if they are Operating System specific. That is, consider the main OS that
                    your program would run on and give related details for them.
            
                    <p>Also, be sure to specify the process if they are Operating System specific. That is, consider the main OS
                        that your
                        program would run on and give related details for them.</p>
            
                    <p>BEWARE: Users may have a hard time with this part of of your READme. Be sure to use simple vocabulary and DO
                        NOT FORGET.
                        Consider every step in this part.</p>
            
                    <h4>Useage:</h4>
                    <p>Once you’re confident about the steps provided in the installation process you provide them with using the
                        application.</p>
            
                    <p>Here you provide examples must be included to show the proper use of your application.</p>
            
                    <h4>Bugs:</h4>
                    <p>Here you do what most us us artists, aka CS majors hate to do. You must include the possible bugs in your
                        code.</p>
            
                    <p>Only you can provide this since you wrote your code and what state it currently is in.</p>
            
                    <h4>License</h4>
                    <p>Sooner or later your application, be it school project or personal prjects may grow and lisencing will be
                        needed.</p>
            
                    <p>By default you have every right to your code, but including a license is important. This is becase of future
                        contributions. Your project may be open to contributions in which case it will be super important to include
                        a license.</p>
            
                    <p>I have very limited knowledge on licensing, however, https://choosealicense.com/ should help you get settle
                        on that.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="list-group">

                    <ol>
                        <li>get them up and running,</li>
                        <li>cut them from having to examin the source code for clarity,</li>
                    </ol>
            
                    <p>And bove all your READme must prevent users from having to reverse engineer your code to figure out your
                        thought process</p>
