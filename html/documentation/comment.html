                    <h2>Commenting</h2>

                    <p>30 minutes into looking at some 2 year old code written by these hands, it hit me! I did not
                        understand my own code. The
                        variable names looked weird, the methods and their parmeters looked weird, and worse of all,
                        what was supposed to serve
                        as my saving grace (comments) was not present. And when it was, it appeared badly written.</p>

                    <p>Funny thing is, the source code was for a group project and not one of the group members
                        complained. We were all present
                        in one room whenever we worked on the project yet nt a single soul felt the need to comment
                        through it.</p>

                    <p>BUT this is bad practice. The present me now suffers the decisions the old me didn’t make which
                        is taking the time to
                        comment though the source code.</p>

                    <p>This tutorial serves to anwser the questions</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What are comments?</li>
                        <li>How to comment.</li>
                        <li>How not to comment.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What then are comment?</p>

                    <p>Commenting as an art is the use of high level language, English (whichever language you speak),
                        to describe what your
                        program does.</p>

                    <h3>NOTE: These are merely guidelines I developed. Take this as a “how I would have commented
                        through my code."</h3>

                    <p>We shall examin some example code, and study how comments should be used in them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="list-group">
                    <p>Consider the following cases</p>

                    <h3>Case A:</h3>

                    <div class="">
                        <p>to be drawn</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Without knowing what the question was, the code written makes some sense. This is heavily due to
                        the presence of
                        comments. If we metally ommit them the variables x, y, a will not make sense, or at least it
                        will take the reader a long
                        time to figure out what the code is meant to do.</p>

                    <p>With the comments serving as explanations you are able to understand that the code calculates the
                        Area of a Rectangle.</p>

                    <h3>Case B:</h3>

                    <div class="">
                        <p>to be drawn</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Again, without having to give it too much thought one is able to deduce from the equation written
                        that it is an equation
                        that uses the variables length and width.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <p>As students, we are expected to comment through our source code. I know, Robert. Dr. Great
                        Professor wants us to write
                        comments on what the code is doing, yet we aren't taught to comment let alone comment properly.
                    </p>

                    <p>We are given the notion that so far as there is a comment, it serves as an explanation, and
                        you’re all set.</p>

                    But that is not the case. As stated by Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, "comments should be to
                    say things that you
                    can not do well in code."
                    Meaning, only put comments inside of your code if your code will be difficult to understand when
                    glanced at.

                    <p>Case 1 will be difficult to understand without comments and Case 2 will have no need for comments
                        as it does a great job
                        of naming variables.</p>

                    <h4>Naturally, most programming languages have 2 commenting approaches to them. They include Inline
                        Commenting & Block
                        Commenting.</h4>


                </div>
                <div class="list-group">
                    <h3>Inline Commenting:</h3>
                    <p>Most programming languages have inline comments, but its use is pretty tricky. They serve the
                        purpose of having to
                        explain code that is not self documenting. That is, if it doesn’t make sense at a glance,
                        comment it.</p>

                    <p>Do not overwhelm yourself or a reader of your code by providing comments for every line of code.
                    </p>

                    <p>Let us consider Case C below.</p>

                    <h4>Case C:</h4>

                    <div class="">
                        <p>to be drawn</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Case C above is what proper commenting should look like. You notice that without having to give
                        it
                        too much thought the
                        equation written is understood.</p>

                    <p>Notice also that naming the variabes very well reduces the chance of redundancy. It is not needed
                        to
                        do the following in
                        lines 1 to 3.</p>

                    <div class="">
                        <p>to be drawn</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>when the variables names have done a good job at that.</p>

                    <p>It stresses the point of commenting. If variables are named properly, providing comments for
                        every
                        line of code becomes
                        unnecessary. You only write comment to explain certain things, i.e. to explain what certain
                        absurd
                        lines of code do.</p>

                    <h4>NOTE: Inline comments can be over used. DO NOT be that one person who has Inline comments on
                        every
                        line</h4>

                </div>

                <div class="list-group">
                    <h2>Block Commenting:</h2>

                    <p>The main purpose to which Block Comments are used is their paragraphing ability. For instance,
                        when
                        you want to inlcude
                        a lengthy explanation as to what a function does, Block Comments become bae. Consider the
                        following;
                    </p>

                    <div class="">
                        <p>to be drawn</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what the above methods do, however, their parameters are
                        confusing. Regularly,
                        one would have to use In-line comments to do a little bit of explaining but thanlkfully that
                        isnt
                        needed. The beauty of
                        Block Commenting can be seen below.</p>

                    <div class="">
                        <p>to be drawn</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The main method/function above uses both Inline and Block Commenting. Looking at it at a glance,
                        the
                        comments bring the
                        dead (absurd) part of the code to life.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="list-group">
                    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>

                    <p>In conclusion one must diligently put in effort in the selection of the identifiers. This means
                        the names of the
                        variables, classes, methods and what not must serve the purpose of their name.</p>

                    <p>The importance of this action is that a properly named identifier cuts the reduces the risk of
                        over commenting which in
                        turn increases the chance of ones understanding.</p>

                    <p>Remember, comments are not for your present self, but for your future self, potential inheritors
                        of your program, and
                        anyone.</p>

                    <p>NOTE: To ensure proper commenting one should employ better naming of identifiers, and comments
                        provided should be for
                        lines of code that are difficult to understand.</p>
