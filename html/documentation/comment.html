                    <p>30 minutes into looking at some 2 year old code written by my hands, it hit me! I was lost. I did not understand my own code. The variables looked new, the methods and their parameters looked off, and worse of all, I had little to no saving grace -- I had no <b>comments</b> in my code.</p>

                    <p>What's worse, the source code I was going through was a group project and not one of the group members complained commenting. We were all <b>present</b> in whenever we worked on the it, yet not a single soul felt there was the need to raise the commenting topic.</p>

                    <p>And now I suffer. The present me now suffers the decisions the old me didn’t make. Not commenting not to comment though the source code.</p>
                    
                    <p>This tutorial serves to deal with a disease. Most of use do not comment through our code. Typing is too much work as it is so why comment? This study guide serves to anwser that quesiton and these:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What are comments?</li>
                        <li>How to comment.</li>
                        <li>How not to comment.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What then are comment?</h3>

                    <p>Commenting as an art is the use of high level language, English (whichever language), to describe what your program does.</p>

                    <p>Generally ignored by compilers and interpreters, they are put in place with the purpose of making source code easier to understand by humans</p>

                    <h3 class="note">NOTE: These are merely guidelines I developed. Take this as a “how I would have commented
                        through my code."</h3>

                    <p>We shall examin some example code, and study how comments should be used in them.</p>
                </div>

                <hr>

                <!-- 2nd div -->
                <div class="list-group">
                    <p>Consider the following cases.</p>

                    <h3>Case A:</h3>

<pre>
    <code class="java">
    // Let x be length
    // Let y be width
    // Let a be area of square

    double x = 0.0;
    double y = 0.0;
    double a = 0.0;
    .
    .
    .
    a = x * y;
    </code>
</pre>

                    <p>At a glance, the code above makes some sense. There isn't the need to decipher and reverse engineer. This is heavily due to the presence of comments. They clarify what is happening within the code.</p>

                    <p>Because code is written is meant for the compiler and intepreter, should we mentally ommit the comments the variables <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>a</b> will not make sense, or at least it will take the reader a long time to figure out.</p>

                    <p>With comments serving as explanations the reader is able to understand that the code calculates the Area of a Rectangle.</p>

                    <h3>Case B:</h3>

<pre>
    <code class="java">
    double length = 0.0;
    double width = 0.0;
    double area = 0.0;
    .
    .
    .
    area = length * width;
    </code>
</pre>

                    <p>Case B above has no comments, however, one is able to understand what it does.</p>

                    <p>Without having to give it too much thought one is able to deduce from the variables names provided that the program calculates the area by taking the length and width in it's calculations.</p>

                    <div class="inbod"

                        <p>As students, we are expected to comment through our source code. I know, Robert Doe! Dr. Great Professor wants us to write comments on what the code does, what it will do, and what it has done. Yet we aren't taught to comment let alone comment properly.</p>
    
                        <p>We are given the notion that so far as there is a comment, it serves as an explanation, and you’re all set.</p>
    
                        <p>But that is not the case. As stated by Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, <q>comments should be to say things that you can not do well in code.</q> Meaning, only put comments inside of your code if your code will be difficult to understand when glanced at.</p>
    
                        <p> <b>Case 1</b> will be difficult to understand without comments and <b>Case 2</b> will have no need for comments as it does a great job of naming variables.</p>
    
                        <p>We will examin the types of comments next.</p>

                    </div>

                <div class="list-group">

                    <p>Naturally (lol), most programming languages have 2 commenting approaches to them. They include <b>Inline Commenting</b> & <b>Block Commenting</b>.</p>

                    <p>We will consider Inline Commenting next.</p>

                    <h3>Inline Commenting:</h3>

                    <p>Most programming languages have inline comments, but its use is pretty tricky. They serve the purpose of having to explain code that is not self documenting. That is, <b>if it doesn’t make sense at a glance, comment it</b>. Programming is a hard task as it is. Saving your future self, and potential readers of what is left of our sanity should be important to us.</p>

                    <p>As a note you myself I say, <q>IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, COMMENT IT!</q></p>

                    <p>However do not be that guy! That one person whose comments outweigh his sourcecode. Yes, Philp Gray. Don't be Philip Gray!</p>

                    <p>Do not overwhelm yourself or a reader of your code by providing comments for every line of code.</p>

                    <p>The world would be a better place if you didn't do that! Save some characters!</p>

                    <p>Let us consider Case C below!</p>

                    <h3>Case C:</h3>

<pre>
    <code class="java">
    double length = 0.0;
    double width = 0.0;
    double area = 0.0;

    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

    length = in.nextDouble(); // allows user input for length
    width = in.nextDouble(); // allows user input for width

    area = length * width;

    System.out.println("The area is " + area);
    </code>
</pre>

                    <p>Case C above is what proper commenting should look like. You notice that without having to give it too much thought the program written is understood.</p>

                    <p>Notice also that naming the variabes properly reduces the chance of redundancy. It is not needed to do the following in lines 1 to 3</p>

<pre>
    <code class="java">
    // Let length be length
    // Let width be width
    // Let area be area of square

    double length = 0.0;
    double width = 0.0;
    double area = 0.0;

    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

    length = in.nextDouble(); // allows user input for length
    width = in.nextDouble(); // allows user input for width

    area = length * width;

    System.out.println("The area is " + area);
    </code>
</pre>

                    <p>when the variables names do a good job at that.</p>

                    <p>It stresses the point of commenting. If variables are named properly, providing comments for every line of code becomes unnecessary. You only write comment to explain certain things, i.e., to explain what certain absurd lines of code do.</p>

                    <p>NOTE: Inline comments can be over used. DO NOT be that one person who has Inline Comments on every line</p>

                    <p>DO NOT be Philp Gray!</p>

                </div>

                <hr>

                <!-- 4th div -->
                <div class="list-group">
                    <h3>Block Commenting:</h3>

                    <p>The power of Block Comments lie their paragraphing ability. For instance, when you want to inlcude a lengthy explanation as to what a function does, Block Comments become bae.</p>

                    <p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre>
    <code class="java">
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("10 + 20 = " + getIntegerSum(10, 20));
        System.out.println("20 x 40 = " + multiplyInteger(20, 40));
    }
    
    public static int getIntegerSum (int i, int j)
    {
        return i + j;
    }
    
    public static int multiplyInteger (int x, int y)
    {
        return x * y;
    }
    </code>
</pre>

                    <p>It doesn’t take a genius to figure out what the above methods do, however, their parameters are confusing. Regularly, one would have to use Inline comments to do a little bit of explaining, but thankfully that isn't needed. The beauty of Block Commenting can be seen below.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="java">
    /**
    * @param args the command line arguments [Unused]
    * @return Nothing
    */
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        int firstInt = in.nextDouble(); // allows user input for length
        int secondInt = in.nextDouble(); // allows user input for width
        
        System.out.println("10 + 20 = " + getIntegerSum(firstInt, secondInt));
        System.out.println("20 x 40 = " + multiplyInteger(firstInt, secondInt));
    }
    
    /**
    * @param i The first integer
    * @param j The second integer
    * @return The sum of the integers
    */
    public static int getIntegerSum (int i, int j)
    {
        return i + j;
    }
    
    /**
    * @param x The first integer
    * @param y The second integer
    * @return Nothing
    */
    public static int multiplyInteger (int x, int y)
    {
        System.out.println("The result is " + (x * y));
    }

    </code>
</pre>

                    <p>The main method/function above uses both Inline and Block Commenting. Looking at it at a glance, the comments bring the dead (absurd) part of the code to life.</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion:</h3>

                    <p>In conclusion one must diligently put in effort in the selection of identifiers. This means the names of the variables, classes, methods and what not must serve the purpose of their name.</p>

                    <p>The importance of this action is that a properly named identifier reduces the risk of over commenting increasing the chance of ones understanding of the sourcecode.</p>
