            <h3>Commenting</h3>
            <h3><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong>:</h3>
            <p>I was recently going through my 2 year old Java program when it hit me. I did not understand my own code at a glance. But why not? I wrote the code myself. The variable names looked weird, the methods and their parmeters looked weird. There were no comments, and if they were present they were badly written.</p>

            <p>Funny thing is, at the time it was a group project and no one complained. Because we were all present in one room whenever we worked on it we didn’t feel the need to comment through it. BUT this is bad practice. The present me is suffering because the old me didn’t take the time to comment though the source.</p>

            <p>This tutorial serves to anwser the questions</p>

            <ul>
                <li>what are comments?</li>
                <li>how to comment.</li>
                <li>how not to comment.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <p>What then are comment?</p>

            <p>Commenting as an art is the use of high level language, English (whichever language you speak), to describe what your program does.</p>

            <p>We shall examin some example code, and study how comments should be used in them.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Case A:</h4>
                    <pre>
                    <code>
        // Let x be length
        // Let y be width
        // Let A be area of square
                        
        int x;
        int y;
        int a;
                        
        a = x * y;
                    </code>
                </pre>

                    <p>Without knowing what the question was, the code written makes some sense. This is heavily due to the presence of comments. If we metally ommit them the variables x, y, a will not make sense, or at least it will take the reader a long time to figure out what the code means.</p>

                    <p>With the comments serving as and explanations you are able to deduce that the code calculates the Area of a Rectangle.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h4>Case A:</h4>
                    <pre>
                    <code>
        // Let x be length
        // Let y be width
        // Let A be area of square
                        
        int x;
        int y;
        int a;
                        
        a = x * y;
                    </code>

            <p><strong><em>Body</em></strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As students, we are expected to comment through our source code. I know, Robert. Dr. Great Professor
                    wants us
                    to write comments on what the code is doing, yet we aren't taught to comment let alone comment
                    properly.</li>
                <li>We are given the notion that so far as there is a comment to explain, then you&rsquo;re all set.</li>
                <li>But that is not the case. As stated &nbsp;by Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, "comments should be
                    to say
                    things that you can not do well in code."</li>
                <li>Sadly, most programming professors have no time to teach how</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Naturally, most programming languages have 2 commenting approaches to them. They include:</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Inline Commenting:</li>
                <li>Descriptive Block Commenting:</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong>:</p>
            <p>In conclusion one must diligently put in effort in the selection of the identifiers. This means the names of
                the
                variables, classes, methods and what not must serve the purpose of their name. The importance of this
                action is
                that a properly named identifier cuts the user from having to provide comments for it.</p>
